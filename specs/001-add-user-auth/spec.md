# Feature Specification: User Authentication Foundations

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-user-auth`  
**Created**: 2025-10-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to start our app by being able to register new users and being able to log in. In addition to being able to register and login we should be able to retrieve the users information using a call to an endpoint. The user should be able to register using his email and password and he or she should be able to log in using the same credentials. The endpoint for retrieving the current user should just return the email for now."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create Account With Email (Priority: P1)

Prospective visitors create an account by submitting an email address and password so they can start using the product.

**Why this priority**: No other experience is possible until a user can create an account, making it the highest-value slice.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a brand-new account via the registration endpoint and confirming the account exists afterward.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor with a unique email, **When** they submit the registration form with a valid password, **Then** the system confirms the account is created and ready for use.
2. **Given** a visitor who provides an email already in use, **When** they attempt to register, **Then** the system rejects the request with a clear explanation that the email is taken.

### User Story 2 - Sign In With Existing Credentials (Priority: P2)

Returning users sign in with the email and password they registered with so they can regain access to the product.

**Why this priority**: Logging in unlocks user retention and is the next critical capability once registration exists.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using valid credentials to obtain an authenticated session and confirming access to protected endpoints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a registered user with correct credentials, **When** they submit a sign-in request, **Then** the system authenticates them and establishes an active session.
2. **Given** a registered user with an incorrect password, **When** they attempt to sign in, **Then** the system declines access and communicates that the credentials are invalid without exposing sensitive details.
3. **Given** a user who just completed registration, **When** they attempt to sign in with the same credentials, **Then** the system authenticates them without requiring interim confirmation steps.

### User Story 3 - View Current Account Details (Priority: P3)

Authenticated users request their own account information to confirm the system recognizes them.

**Why this priority**: While a lower priority than creating or accessing the account, users benefit from verifying what profile data the system stores about them.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by calling the "current user" endpoint with a valid session and confirming the email is returned, and by ensuring unauthenticated calls are blocked.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they call the current-user endpoint, **Then** the response includes the email associated with their account.
2. **Given** a request without an active session, **When** it calls the current-user endpoint, **Then** the system refuses the request and indicates authentication is required.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when registration is attempted with an invalid email format?
- How does the system respond when the password does not meet minimum length requirements?
- How are repeated failed sign-in attempts handled to discourage brute-force access?
- What happens when a session expires before a current-user request is made?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a way for prospective users to create an account using an email address and password.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST validate registration inputs, including checking email format and enforcing minimum password rules communicated to the user.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST prevent account creation when the submitted email already exists and must explain the conflict to the user.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow registered users, including newly created accounts, to authenticate with their email and password without additional activation steps and receive confirmation of success or failure.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST establish and maintain an authenticated session or equivalent token after successful sign-in so that subsequent requests are recognized.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide an authenticated endpoint that returns the current user's email address when requested.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST block unauthenticated or expired sessions from accessing protected endpoints and return clear messaging about the need to sign in.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Represents an individual account with attributes including a unique email address and credential metadata required for authentication.
- **Authenticated Session**: Represents the active relationship between a signed-in user and the system, enabling authorized access to user-specific endpoints until it expires or is revoked.

## Assumptions

- Email addresses function as unique identifiers for user accounts, with verification handled as a future enhancement.
- Password policy requires, at minimum, eight characters; detailed complexity rules can evolve later without changing this feature scope.
- Authenticated sessions are maintained through a secure mechanism that persists between requests until explicitly ended or timed out.
- Email confirmation is not required before the first sign-in; users may authenticate immediately after registering.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-19

- Q: Should newly registered users be forced to confirm their email before first login? â†’ A: Allow users to log in immediately after successful registration.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: At least 90% of new visitors who start registration complete account creation without assistance on their first attempt.
- **SC-002**: Returning users experience successful sign-in within two attempts in at least 95% of cases measured over a rolling two-week period.
- **SC-003**: Authenticated users receive confirmation of their signed-in status (via current-user response) in under 2 seconds for 95% of requests.
- **SC-004**: Support contacts related to registration or sign-in issues remain below 5% of total support volume for the month following launch.
