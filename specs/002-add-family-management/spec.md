# Feature Specification: Family Management

**Feature Branch**: `[002-add-family-management]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I now want to implement family management into our api. This would mean being able to create a family in our application which can optionally be given a name. The user who creates the family should be linked to that family as a Parent. Possible types of roles are Parent and Child. The creator of the family by default will be designated as a Parent."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-20

- Q: Should a user be allowed multiple memberships per family or only one? → A: Single membership per family, one role


## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create a new family (Priority: P1)

An authenticated user creates a new family profile, optionally providing a family name, and is automatically linked to it as a Parent.

**Why this priority**: Enables users to form the core family entity, which is prerequisite for any collaboration features tied to family membership.

**Independent Test**: Verify that a user can create a family through the service and receives confirmation showing their Parent role without invoking other stories.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a signed-in user, **When** they submit a request to create a family with a name, **Then** a new family is created, the name is recorded, and the user is linked as a Parent.
2. **Given** a signed-in user, **When** they create a family without providing a name, **Then** the family is created with no name value and the user is linked as a Parent.

### User Story 2 - View owned families (Priority: P2)

A user reviews the families they belong to and confirms their role assignments after creating or joining a family.

**Why this priority**: Users need visibility into which families exist and their roles to manage subsequent actions like inviting other members in future releases.

**Independent Test**: Request the family list for a user and confirm the newly created family appears with the correct role metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user who has created a family, **When** they request their family list, **Then** the response includes the new family with the user designated as a Parent.

---

### User Story 3 - Prevent invalid role assignments (Priority: P3)

The system rejects any attempt to assign a family role outside the supported Parent or Child options when creating or updating memberships.

**Why this priority**: Maintaining data integrity prevents unsupported role types from degrading downstream logic or reporting.

**Independent Test**: Attempt to assign an unauthorized role and confirm the request is denied with a clear validation error.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a request containing a role value other than Parent or Child, **When** the system processes the membership assignment, **Then** it rejects the request and returns an error describing the allowed roles.

### Edge Cases

- Attempting to create a second family with the exact same name; the system must allow duplicates while ensuring users can distinguish families via identifiers.
- User tries to create a family while already belonging to multiple families; creation should still succeed and maintain all memberships.
- Requests with missing authentication; the system must refuse family creation or retrieval without valid credentials.
- A membership assignment call omits a role; the system must fail the operation and surface a descriptive validation message.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authenticated users to create a family profile with an optional display name.
- **FR-002**: System MUST persist the creator as a family member with the Parent role at the moment of family creation.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a way for users to retrieve all families they belong to, including their role for each membership.
- **FR-004**: System MUST restrict family membership roles to Parent or Child and reject any other values.
- **FR-005**: System MUST record timestamps for when families are created and memberships are established to support auditing and future reporting.
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure each user can hold only one membership per family and maintain a single role at any given time.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Family**: Represents a household unit created by a user; stores a unique identifier, optional name, creator reference, and lifecycle timestamps.
- **Family Membership**: Links a user to a family with an associated role (Parent or Child), membership status, and creation timestamp. Ensures a user has at most one active membership per family, with exactly one role.
- **Role**: Enumerated set defining allowable relationship types within a family (Parent, Child); used for validation and authorization decisions.

### Assumptions

- Users may belong to multiple families simultaneously, and creating a new family does not affect existing memberships.
- Family names are not required to be unique; users rely on identifiers or contextual data to differentiate similar names.
- Role management for inviting or switching roles of other members is out of scope for this feature and will be addressed in future iterations.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of authenticated users can create a family on their first attempt without requiring support intervention.
- **SC-002**: Newly created families appear in the creator’s family list within 5 seconds of submission during testing.
- **SC-003**: 100% of family membership records show a valid role (Parent or Child) during quality assurance reviews.
- **SC-004**: Fewer than 5% of support inquiries about missing or incorrect family roles are reported in the first month after launch.
