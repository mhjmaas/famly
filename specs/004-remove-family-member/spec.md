# Feature Specification: Remove Family Members

**Feature Branch**: `[004-remove-family-member]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to be able to remove a family member. In this case it is only unlinking the family member from a family. Only a member with the parent role is allowd to remove a family member."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Parent removes a member (Priority: P1)

A parent managing the household roster wants to immediately revoke a member's access when circumstances change.

**Why this priority**: Protects family privacy and keeps membership accurate, which is critical to household management.

**Independent Test**: Log in as a parent, remove an existing family member, and confirm the member no longer has family access or appears in the roster.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in parent viewing the family roster, **When** they confirm removal of a member linked to the same family, **Then** the member is unlinked, the roster updates immediately, and the parent receives confirmation.
2. **Given** a member was removed, **When** that individual next attempts to access family-only content, **Then** the system blocks access and directs them to rejoin a family.

---

### User Story 2 - Parent manages co-parent access (Priority: P2)

An administrative parent needs to revoke another parent's access while ensuring the family retains at least one manager.

**Why this priority**: Maintains proper guardianship control and avoids leaving the family without oversight.

**Independent Test**: Attempt to remove a co-parent while another parent remains and verify success; then attempt to remove the final parent and confirm the action is blocked with guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a family with multiple parents, **When** a parent removes another parent, **Then** the target parent loses access and remaining parents retain management privileges.
2. **Given** a family with only one parent, **When** that parent tries to remove themselves or the only other parent, **Then** the system prevents the action and explains why.

---

### User Story 3 - Non-parent cannot remove members (Priority: P3)

Family members without the parent role must be prevented from altering the household roster.

**Why this priority**: Safeguards against unauthorized removals and keeps authority with designated caregivers.

**Independent Test**: Log in as a non-parent family member, attempt to access any removal action, and confirm it is unavailable or blocked with an explanatory message.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in member with a non-parent role, **When** they attempt to trigger the removal flow, **Then** the option is disabled or denied with a clear explanation.

---

### Edge Cases

- Parent attempts to remove the only remaining parent and must be guided to assign another parent first.
- Parent attempts to remove someone who has already been removed or never belonged to the family and receives a clear error without changing state.
- Parent tries to remove a member who currently has pending obligations (e.g., scheduled events); the system confirms the removal will cancel their access to those items.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authenticated family members with the parent role to initiate removal of a specific member from their family roster.
- **FR-002**: System MUST verify the selected member currently belongs to the same family as the initiating parent and display a descriptive error if not.
- **FR-003**: System MUST restrict all removal actions to users who hold the parent role within that family and block non-parent attempts.
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent completion of a removal that would leave the family without at least one parent and explain the requirement to the initiating user.
- **FR-005**: System MUST immediately revoke the removed member's access to family-only content, notifications, and permissions once the unlinking is confirmed.
- **FR-006**: System MUST confirm successful removal to the initiating parent and refresh any family roster views to reflect the change within the same interaction.
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain the removed member's underlying account while severing the family relationship so they may join or form other families later.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Family**: Household group that owns shared content, requires at least one active parent, and references its current members.
- **Family Membership**: Association between a user account and a family, including role and history of changes.

## Assumptions

- Removal flow is initiated from the existing family management area where parents currently add members and review the roster.
- Removed members receive existing membership-change notifications informing them that access has been revoked.
- Scheduling or shared responsibilities owned solely by the removed member are reassigned or cancelled according to current family policies outside this feature scope.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22

- Q: Should the system capture a reason when parents remove a member? â†’ A: Do not capture reasons

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of parent participants in moderated testing remove an existing member successfully on their first attempt without facilitator help.
- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts by non-parent roles to remove members are blocked with an explanatory message during acceptance testing.
- **SC-003**: 90% of removal actions are reflected in the family roster view within 30 seconds of confirmation during system testing.
- **SC-004**: 90% of parent participants report roster clarity immediately after removal without needing manual refresh.
