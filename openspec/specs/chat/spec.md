- **GIVEN** a user has an active Socket.IO connection
- **WHEN** the socket disconnects
- **THEN** the socketId is removed from the user's device set
- **AND** if the user has no remaining active sockets, a `presence:update { userId, status: "offline" }` event is broadcast to contacts

#### Scenario: Throttle presence updates
- **GIVEN** a user connects and disconnects rapidly (3 times in 1 second)
- **WHEN** these presence changes occur
- **THEN** presence broadcasts are throttled to a maximum of 1 update per 2 seconds per user
- **AND** only the final state is broadcast after the throttle window

#### Scenario: Handle presence ping
- **GIVEN** an authenticated Socket.IO connection
- **WHEN** the client emits `presence:ping {}`
- **THEN** the server updates the user's last-seen timestamp
- **AND** returns `{ ok: true; data: { serverTime: <ISO timestamp> } }`

### Requirement: Chat Metadata Updates via REST Integration
When chat metadata changes via REST endpoints (membership changes, title updates), those changes SHALL be broadcast to affected users via Socket.IO.

#### Scenario: Broadcast chat update on membership change
- **GIVEN** UserA is a member of a group chat
- **WHEN** an admin adds UserB via REST `POST /chats/:chatId/members`
- **THEN** the REST handler emits a `chat:update` event internally
- **AND** the Socket.IO server broadcasts `chat:update { chat: ChatDTO }` to all members in `user:<userId>` rooms
- **AND** UserA receives the updated chat object with the new member

#### Scenario: Broadcast chat update on title change
- **GIVEN** a group chat with title "Old Title"
- **WHEN** an admin updates the title via REST (future endpoint)
- **THEN** a `chat:update` event is broadcast to all members

### Requirement: Reconnection and Backfill Strategy
Clients SHALL backfill missed messages using REST endpoints after reconnecting to Socket.IO.

#### Scenario: Client reconnects and backfills
- **GIVEN** a client was disconnected and missed messages
- **WHEN** the client reconnects to Socket.IO
- **THEN** the client authenticates successfully
- **AND** the client queries REST `GET /chats/:chatId/messages?before=<lastKnownMessageId>`
- **AND** the client receives missed messages in the response
- **AND** the client emits `room:join { chatId }` to resume realtime updates
- **AND** subsequent messages arrive via `message:new` events

### Requirement: Error Handling and Acknowledgments
All Socket.IO request events SHALL return acknowledgments following a unified error shape.

#### Scenario: Successful acknowledgment
- **GIVEN** a client emits a valid event
- **WHEN** the server processes the event successfully
- **THEN** the acknowledgment is `{ ok: true }` or `{ ok: true; data: <payload> }`

#### Scenario: Error acknowledgment with correlation ID
- **GIVEN** a client emits an event that causes a server error
- **WHEN** the server encounters an internal error
- **THEN** the acknowledgment is `{ ok: false; error: "INTERNAL"; message: "An error occurred"; correlationId: <uuid> }`
- **AND** the correlationId is logged for tracing

#### Scenario: Standard error codes
- **GIVEN** various error conditions
- **THEN** errors use standard codes:
  - `UNAUTHORIZED` - Not authenticated
  - `FORBIDDEN` - Authenticated but not authorized
  - `VALIDATION_ERROR` - Invalid payload
  - `RATE_LIMITED` - Too many requests
  - `NOT_FOUND` - Resource doesn't exist
  - `INTERNAL` - Server error

### Requirement: Realtime Message Ordering
Clients SHALL render messages in chronological order using server-authoritative timestamps.

#### Scenario: Messages ordered by server timestamp
- **GIVEN** multiple messages arrive via `message:new` events
- **WHEN** the client receives these messages
- **THEN** the client sorts messages by `createdAt` (server timestamp) ascending
- **AND** ties are broken by `_id` (ObjectId) ascending
- **AND** client-side timestamps are NEVER used for ordering

### Requirement: Socket.IO Event Logging
All Socket.IO events SHALL be logged with appropriate detail for monitoring and debugging.

#### Scenario: Log connection events
- **GIVEN** a Socket.IO connection is established or terminated
- **WHEN** the event occurs
- **THEN** the server logs the event with level INFO
- **AND** the log includes userId, socketId, and connection status

#### Scenario: Log message events
- **GIVEN** a message is sent via Socket.IO
- **WHEN** the `message:send` event is processed
- **THEN** the server logs with level INFO
- **AND** the log includes chatId, userId, messageId, and isIdempotent flag

#### Scenario: Log errors
- **GIVEN** an error occurs during event processing
- **WHEN** the error is caught
- **THEN** the server logs with level ERROR
- **AND** the log includes error message, stack trace, userId, and correlationId
